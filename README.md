# SolarCar-ChargingDisplay

Controls a touchscreen GUI display for monitoring the battery pack during stationary charging on the Principia RaXI solar car. Takes information from the Orion BMS and displays it on the GUI.

This project is a copy from the private Principia Solar Car repository and excludes library and include files for privacy. I contributed alongside two other developers in coding, debugging, and testing this project.

The project uses the PIO and Arduino libraries to control a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.
